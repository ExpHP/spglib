Installation
-------------

Source codes, examples, and the test are downloaded `SourceForge
<https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=215020>`_ or
`GitHub
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/releases>`_.

Using package distribution service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to install python-spglib is to use the pypi package,
for which numpy is required to be installed before the
installation. A command to install spglib is::

   % pip install spglib

Previous versions < 1.8.x are installed by::

   % pip install pyspglib

Conda is another choice::

   % conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/jochym spglib

These packages are made by Paweł T. Jochym.

Building using setup.py (distutils)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To manually install python-spglib using ``setup.py``, python header files
(python-dev), gcc, and numpy are required before the build. The
installation steps are shown as follows:

1. Go to the :file:`python` directory
2. Type the command::

      % python setup.py install --home=<my-directory>

   The :file:`{<my-directory>}` is possibly current directory, :file:`.`
   or maybe::

      % python setup.py install --user

   to use the user scheme (see the python document.)

3. Put :file:`./lib/python` path into :envvar:`$PYTHONPATH`, e.g., in your
   .washrag.

Test
-----

The test script :file:`test_spglib.py` is found in :file:`python/test`
directory. Got to this directory and run this script. It will be like below::

   % python test_spglib.py
   test_get_symmetry_dataset (__main__.TestSpglib) ... ok
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 1 test in 2.132s
   
   OK

How to import spglib module
---------------------------

**Change in version 1.9.0!**

For versions 1.9.x or later::

   import spglib     

For versions 1.8.x or before::

   from pyspglib import spglib

If the version is not sure::

   try:
       import spglib as spg
   except ImportError:
       from pyspglib import spglib as spg   

Version number
--------------

In version 1.8.3 or later, the version number is obtained by
``spglib.__version__`` or :ref:`method_get_version`.

Example
--------

Examples are found in `examples
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/tree/master/python/examples>`_
directory.

Variables
----------

.. _variables_crystal_structure:

Crystal structure (``cell``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A crystal structure is given by a **tuple**. This tuple format
is supported at version 1.9.1 or later. Optionally, an **ASE Atoms-like
object** is also supported. An alternative Atoms class (`atoms.py
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/blob/master/python/examples/atoms.py>`_)
that contains minimum set of methods is prepared in the `examples
<https://github.com/atztogo/spglib/tree/master/python/examples>`_
directory.

The tuple format is shown as follows. There are three or four elements
in the tuple: ``cell = (lattice, positions, numbers)`` or ``cell =
(lattice, positions, numbers, magmoms)`` where ``magmoms`` is
optional.

Lattice parameters ``lattice`` are given by a 3x3 matrix with floating
point values. Fractional atomic positions ``positions`` are given by a
Nx3 matrix with floating point values, where N is the number of
atoms. Numbers to distinguish atomic species ``numbers`` are given
by a list of N integers. Collinear magnetic moments ``magmoms`` are
given by a list of N floating point values.

::

   lattice = [[a_x, a_y, a_z],
              [b_x, b_y, b_z],
              [c_x, c_y, c_z]]
   positions = [[a_1, b_1, c_1],
                [a_2, b_2, c_2],
                [a_3, b_3, c_3],
                ...]
   numbers = [n_1, n_2, n_3, ...]
   magmoms = [m_1, m_2, m_3, ...]

Symmetry tolerance (``symprec``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distance tolerance in Cartesian coordinates to find crystal symmetry.

Methods
--------

.. _method_get_version:

``get_version``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New in version 1.8.3**

::

    version = get_version()

This returns version number of spglib by tuple with three numbers.

``get_spacegroup``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    spacegroup = get_spacegroup(cell, symprec=1e-5)

International space group short symbol and number are obtained as a
string. With ``symbol_type=1``, Schoenflies symbol is given instead of
international symbol.

``get_symmetry``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    symmetry = get_symmetry(cell, symprec=1e-5)

Symmetry operations are obtained as a dictionary. The key ``rotation``
contains a numpy array of integer, which is "number of symmetry
operations" x "3x3 matrices". The key ``translation`` contains a numpy
array of float, which is "number of symmetry operations" x
"vectors". The orders of the rotation matrices and the translation
vectors correspond with each other, e.g. , the second symmetry
operation is organized by the second rotation matrix and second
translation vector in the respective arrays. The operations are
applied for the fractional coordinates (not for Cartesian
coordinates).

The rotation matrix and translation vector are used as follows::

    new_vector[3x1] = rotation[3x3] * vector[3x1] + translation[3x1]

The three values in the vector are given for the a, b, and c axes,
respectively.

``refine_cell``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Behaviour changed in version 1.8.x**

::

    lattice, scaled_positions, numbers = refine_cell(cell, symprec=1e-5)

Bravais lattice (3x3 numpy array), atomic scaled positions (a numpy
array of [number_of_atoms,3]), and atomic numbers (a 1D numpy array)
that are symmetrized following space group type are returned. When it
fails, ``None`` is returned.

The detailed control of standardization of unit cell may be done using
``standardize_cell``.

``find_primitive``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Behaviour changed in version 1.8.x**

::

   lattice, scaled_positions, numbers = find_primitive(cell, symprec=1e-5)

When a primitive cell is found, lattice parameters (3x3 numpy array),
scaled positions (a numpy array of [number_of_atoms,3]), and atomic
numbers (a 1D numpy array) is returned. When it fails, ``None`` is returned.

The detailed control of standardization of unit cell can be done using
``standardize_cell``.

``standardize_cell``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New in version 1.8.x**

::

   lattice, scaled_positions, numbers = standardize_cell(bulk, to_primitive=False, no_idealize=False, symprec=1e-5)

``to_primitive=True`` is used to create the standardized primitive
cell, and ``no_idealize=True`` disables to idealize lengths and angles
of basis vectors and positions of atoms according to crystal
symmetry. Now ``refine_cell`` and ``find_primitive`` are shorthands of
this method with combinations of these options. When it fails,
``None`` is returned. More detailed explanation is shown in the spglib
(C-API) document.

``get_symmetry_dataset``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**At version 1.9.4, the member 'choice' is added.**

::

    dataset = get_symmetry_dataset(cell, symprec=1e-5)

``dataset`` is a dictionary. The keys are:

* ``number``: International space group number
* ``international``: International short symbol
* ``hall``: Hall symbol
* ``choice``: Centring, origin, basis vector setting
* ``transformation_matrix``: Transformation matrix from lattice of input cell to Bravais lattice :math:`L^{bravais} = L^{original} * T`
* ``origin shift``: Origin shift choice in the setting of Bravais lattice
* ``wyckoffs``: Wyckoff letters
* ``equivalent_atoms``: Mapping table to equivalent atoms
* ``rotations`` and ``translations``: Rotation matrices and
  translation vectors. Space group operations are obtained by::

    [(r, t) for r, t in zip(dataset['rotations'], dataset['translations'])]

..
   * ``pointgrouop_number``: Serial number of the crystallographic point
     group, which refers list of space groups (Seto’s web site)

* ``pointgroup_symbol``: Symbol of the crystallographic point group in
  the Hermann–Mauguin notation.
* ``std_lattice``, ``std_positions``, ``std_types``: Standardized
  crystal structure corresponding to a Hall symbol found. These are
  equivalently given in the array formats of ``lattice``,
  ``positions``, and ``numbers`` presented at
  :ref:`variables_crystal_structure`, respectively.

``get_symmetry_from_database``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   symmetry = get_symmetry_from_database(hall_number)

A set of crystallographic symmetry operations corresponding to
``hall_number`` is returned by a dictionary where rotation parts and
translation parts are accessed by the keys ``rotations`` and
``translations``, respectively. The definition of ``hall_number`` is
found at :ref:`api_spg_get_dataset_spacegroup_type`.

``get_spacegroup_type``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New at version 1.9.4**

::

   spacegroup_type = get_spacegroup_type(hall_number)

This function allows to directly access to the space-group-type
database in spglib (spg_database.c). A dictionary is returned. To
specify the space group type with a specific choice, ``hall_number``
is used. The definition of ``hall_number`` is found at
:ref:`api_spg_get_dataset_spacegroup_type`. The keys of the returned
dictionary is as follows:

::

   number
   international_short
   international_full
   international
   schoenflies
   hall_symbol
   choice
   pointgroup_schoenflies
   pointgroup_international
   arithmetic_crystal_class_number
   arithmetic_crystal_class_symbol

Here ``spacegroup_type['international_short']`` is equivalent to
``dataset['international']`` of ``get_symmetry_dataset``,
``spacegroup_type['hall_symbol']`` is equivalent to
``dataset['hall']`` of ``get_symmetry_dataset``, and
``spacegroup_type['pointgroup_international']`` is equivalent to
``dataset['pointgroup_symbol']`` of ``get_symmetry_dataset``.

``niggli_reduce``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New at version 1.9.4**

::

   niggli_lattice = niggli_reduce(lattice, eps=1e-5)

Niggli reduction is achieved using this method. The algorithm detail
is found at https://atztogo.github.io/niggli/ and the references are
there in. Basis vectors are stored in ``lattice`` and
``niggli_lattice`` as shown in
:ref:`variables_crystal_structure`. ``esp`` is the tolerance
parameter, but unlike ``symprec`` the unit is not a length. This is used
to check if difference of norms of two basis vectors is close to zero
or not and if two basis vectors are orthogonal by the value of dot product
being close to zero or not.  The detail is shown at
https://atztogo.github.io/niggli/.

``delaunay_reduce``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New at version 1.9.4**

::

   delaunay_lattice = delaunay_reduce(lattice, eps=1e-5)

Delaunay reduction is achieved using this method. The algorithm is
found in the international tables for crystallography volume A. Basis
vectors are stored in ``lattice`` and ``niggli_lattice`` as shown in
:ref:`variables_crystal_structure`. ``esp`` is the tolerance
parameter, but unlike ``symprec`` the unit is not a length. This is
used as the criterion if volume is close to zero or not and if two
basis vectors are orthogonal by the value of dot product being close
to zero or not.

``get_ir_reciprocal_mesh``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   mapping, grid = get_ir_reciprocal_mesh(mesh, cell, is_shift=[0, 0, 0])

Irreducible k-points are obtained from a sampling mesh of k-points.
``mesh`` is given by three integers by array and specifies mesh
numbers along reciprocal primitive axis. ``is_shift`` is given by the
three integers by array. When ``is_shift`` is set for each reciprocal
primitive axis, the mesh is shifted along the axis in half of adjacent
mesh points irrespective of the mesh numbers. When the value is not 0,
``is_shift`` is set.

``mapping`` and ``grid`` are returned. ``grid`` gives the mesh points in
fractional coordinates in reciprocal space. ``mapping`` gives mapping to
the irreducible k-point indices that are obtained by ::

   np.unique(mapping)

Here ``np`` is the imported numpy module. The grid point is accessed
by ``grid[index]``.

For example, the irreducible k-points in fractional coordinates are
obtained by ::

   ir_grid = []
   mapping, grid = get_ir_reciprocal_mesh([ 8, 8, 8 ], cell, [1, 1, 1])
   for i in np.unique(mapping):
       ir_grid.append(grid[i])
